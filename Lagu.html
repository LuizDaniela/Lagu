       Heart beats fast
Colours and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
Watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer
I have died every night waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'd love you for a thousand more
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this
One step closer
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'd love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'd love you for a thousand more
I love you
I'd love you for a thousand
I'd love you for a thousand years
So in love
So in love
One step closer
One step closer
I have died every night waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'd love you for a thousand more
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thou-thousand years
I'd love you for a thousand more
